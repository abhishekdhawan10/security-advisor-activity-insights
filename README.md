# Intro
Follow the steps below to install an agent that will run on one of your Kubernetes clusters to collect audit flow logs from your IBM Cloud Account. These audit flow logs will be stored in your Cloud Object Storage (COS) instance. You can then enable Security Advisor Activity Insights to analyze your activity flow logs to detect and alert you to suspicious activity.

# Prerequisites
- For Windows 10, Before starting with steps mentioned above, activate WSL(windows subsystem for linux) and install [ubuntu shell](https://win10faq.com/install-run-ubuntu-bash-windows-10/)
- yq CLI
  - For MacOS, Windows 10: Install [yq CLI](http://mikefarah.github.io/yq/)
  - For CentOS, Red Hat and Ubuntu : Install yq CLI version 1.15 using below steps:      
  `wget https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/download/1.15.0/yq_linux_amd64`       
  `mv yq_linux_amd64 yq`     
  `chmod +x yq`     
  `mv yq /usr/local/bin/`       
  `yq -V`       
- curl binary
  - For CentOS and Red Hat, update curl binary using `yum update -y nss curl libcurl`
- Install [Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) v1.10.11 or higher
- Install [Kubernetes Helm (package manager)](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#from-script) v2.9.0 or higher
- Please verify whether helm TLS is enabled before proceeding with installation. It is recommended to [enable TLS](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/tiller_ssl.md) in your helm tiller.                        
  **Note**:            
    - If you are using workstation to handle installation of analytics components in multiple clusters - and the helm TLS is enabled - please make sure that the TLS configurations in your workstation is current and corresponding to current cluster where you are planing to install these components.

# Steps to run
1) Download the tar file.
2) Unzip using `tar -xvf security-advisor-activity-insights.tar`
3) `cd security-advisor-activity-insights`
4) Run `./activity-insight-install.sh <cos_region> <cos_api_key> <at_region> <account_api_key> <account_spaces>`
     - <cos_region> value is either us-south or eu-gb â€“ the region where your COS is deployed
     - <cos_api_key> is the [api key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage/iam/service-credentials.html#service-credentials) you created to access your COS instance and bucket should have a Writer Role
     - <at_region> value is either us-south or eu-gb - the region of the [Activity Tracker](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-activity-tracker/index.html#getting-started-with-cla) instance
     - <account_api_key> is the platform [api key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam/apikeys.html#ibm-cloud-api-keys) of your IBM Cloud account
     - <account_spaces> comma seperate list of [IBM account space GUID](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/reference/ibmcloud/cli_acct_org_role.html#ibmcloud_account_space)
5) Verify the installation :
     - `helm ls | grep activity-insights` should return a helm release named `activity-insights` in DEPLOYED state, use `--tls` flag if helm is TLS enabled.
     - `kubectl get pods -n security-advisor-insights | grep activity-insights` should return one pod related to `activity-insights` in RUNNING state.

**Note**:
- If you create your COS instance and bucket manually (not via Security Advisor UI), make sure to use the following naming convention for the bucket: sa.<account_id>.telemetric.<cos_region>. Also set up service-to-service [authorization](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam/authorizations.html#serviceauth) in IBM Cloud IAM for Security Advisor to read data from your COS instance. Set the source service to Security Advisor and the target service to your  cloud object storage instance with a Reader IAM role.
- Take the rule packages and upload to your cos bucket. Default set of rule packages can be found [here](https://github.ibm.com/security-services/security-advisor-project-management/wiki/Doc-page-for-Activity-Insights).

# Deleting the setup
1) `helm del --purge activity-insights` , use `--tls` flag if helm is TLS enabled.
2) `kubectl delete ns security-advisor-insights`

# Troubleshooting
1) If you get an error something like `Error: incompatible versions client and server`, run `helm init --upgrade`
2) If you get an error like : `namespaces security-advisor-insights is forbidden: User system:serviceaccount:kube-system:default cannot get resource namespaces in API group in thenamespace security-advisor-insights`, please fix the [helm setup](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers/cs_integrations.html#helm), as the kube-system default service account does not have the cluster-admin access in your cluster.
